1. What is React ?
- React is JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It's main features are it's reusable UI components, Virtual DOM, Declarative programming languages,
faster development, lesser code, easy to maintain.

2. What are the key features of React ?
- Components: Reusable UI elements
- Virtual DOM: Minimizes changes made to real DOM elements
- One way Data Binding
- Event Handling
- Hooks & Redux for state management
- Router Library for Routing functionality

3. What is JSX ? Why is it used in React? 
- JavaScriptXML is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows HTML like code in
JavaScript files. 
- It's used because it provides easier syntax  by combining HTML and JavaScript code.
- This makes development faster. 

4. What is the difference between a functional component and a class component?
- 

5. What is the virtual DOM and how does React use it ?
- Virtual DOM is a lightweight version of the real DOM and it is used to improve performance.
- It minimizes changes made to the real DOM. 
- Boosts rendering speed 

6. Explain the concept of state in React. 
- State is an object or variable that stores dynamic data which can change overtime. 
- Whenever state changes it causes the component to re render. 
- We have to initialize the state with some value. 
- And last it's updated using setstate()

7. What is the difference between state and props ?
-  state is used for user input, form data, status, etc. props is used for passing data 
from parent to child component. state change triggers componenet re render. props cant change &
they dont trigger re render

8. What is lifting state in React ?
- 

9. What are React Hooks ? Name a few commonly used hooks. 
- Hooks are function that let you use state and lifecycle methods from within
your functional components. 

- useState: manage state data. 
- useEffect: Handle side effects like event listeners
- useReducer: Manage multiple states. 
- useCallback - Memoize functions to prevent uneeded callbakcs

10. Use of useEffect hooks
- 

11. Handle component lifecycle events 
- render() method, contructor()

12. What are pure components in react
- 

13. What is React's useState hook ? How does it work ?
- Lets you add state to functional components. 
- Initializes state with a default value. and then returns 2 things. 
- state value and stateUpdate function 
- Suntax - const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

14. What is the purpsoe of keys in React ? 
- uniquely be able to identify components

15. Diff betwn controlled and uncontrolled components.
- 

16. What is the context API in react ? how does it work ?
- contrxt API is a state management feature that allows data sharing
 betw components without usingprop drilling

17. What is prop drilling and how can it be avoided ?
- process of passing props down from multiple levels. Making code hard to maintain 
- To avoid prop drilling use React's context api. or other global statement libraires 
like Redux, etc

18. What are higher order components. 
- takes a componenet as arguement and returns new component 

19. How to optimize performance in a React application ?
- Use all Memo related functions that prevent unneeded callbacks and re renders
- Memo, useMemo, useCallback
- Avoid deep nesting things to prevent drilling.
- Use a central state management libraay like Redux, etc.

20. What is React Rouer and how it is implemented ?
- Used to manage routing i.e opening different webpages in a single application.

21. What is laxy loading and how ti can be use in react.js
- It is a technique to load components or resources
 only when needed improving performance.

22. How does a server- size rendering (SSR) work in React ?
- SSR renders React components on the server sending the rendered HTML to the client

23. Diff between React and React Native ?
- React is web application framework, runs on web browsers and renders HTML and CSS.
- Native is mobile application framework, runs on mobile devies and renders native UI components


24. What are portals and when would you use them ?
- 

25. What is the use of useRef hook in React ?
- creates a changable reference to a variable. This value doesnt change across component re renders.

26. Diff between useCallback and useMemo hooks ?
- useCallback memoizes functions, prevents function re-creation. useMemo memoizes values, prevents heavy calculations of a specific 
component affect render times of other components


27. Manage form in React
-

28. error boundaries in React 
-

29 . What is useReducer hook and when would u use it 
- 

30. what is React strict.mode and how does it help ?
- development mode that hepls identify issues in ur application. 
better performance, reduced bugs, easier to maintain.
